## What is it?
This is my personal blog, built with Zend Framework 2 and Doctrine 2.

## Disclaimer
I wouldn't recommend downloading and using it as your blog.  It's my first project with these two libraries, so there's more than likely bugs and security issues.  Plus some things are hard coded.  I'm using it more as a resource to learn Zend Framework and Doctrine.
